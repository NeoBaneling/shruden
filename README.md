# Shruden
## Introduction
A simple Game Boy Advance Minigame

Shruden was developed in Spring of 2019 for a Media Device Architecture class at Georgia Tech. It was written in C and compiled into the Game Boy Advance emulator visualboyadvance-m, which can be dowloaded <a href="https://github.com/visualboyadvance-m/visualboyadvance-m/releases" target="_blank">here</a>. All characters and menus are generated programatically (no sprites used). Click <a href="https://neobaneling.github.io/shruden.html" target="_blank">here</a> for more information about the project.

## Gameplay
The player controls a blue square named Blip and must collect green coins while avoiding the red Blarp and pink Bloop.

NOTE: Controls in the game are written as if they were on the Game Boy Advance. For sake of clarity, controls are written here both as they are in the game in quotation marks, and as they would actually be on the keyboard.

Press "Start" Enter to navigate through most menus.

Press "Select" Delete to navigate from Pause menu to Start menu.

Press "D-Pad Keys" Arrow Keys to move Blip, the blue square.
