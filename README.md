# Shruden
A simple Game Boy Advance Minigame

Shruden was developed in Spring of 2019 for a Media Device Architecture class at Georgia Tech. It was written in C and compiled into the Game Boy Advance emulator visualboyadvance-m, which can be dowloaded <a href="https://github.com/visualboyadvance-m/visualboyadvance-m/releases" target="_blank">here</a>. All characters and menus are generated programatically (no sprites used). Click <a href="neobaneling.github.io/shruden" target="_blank">here</a> for more information about the project.
